\begin{abstract}
	In this milestone report we are going to propose the problems we want to solve aiming at our goal of implementing the visual game Gambody. We will clarify the technical approach we are using at present and what we have achieved so far. The remaining milestones including the dates and sub-goals will be given furthermore.

\section{Introduction}
	\par
		We found a popular game called \textit{Hole in the Wall}. In this game one (or two) player(s) are facing a moving wall with a certain shape of hole, the player have to make certain pose to pass the moving wall or he will be pushed into the water.
		Such game is interesting but householders can never have the privilege to play in family gatherings or parties since one can hardly find a moving wall nor adequate safety measurements.

	\par

	\par
		To fix this, we are going to implement a system based on camera so that every one can play this game.
		In our work, we will be using camera to track real person, it will also give player a bounding box (moving wall).
		The box and player's outfit is compared by our system, the return should be a pass (True) or no pass (False).
